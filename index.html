							<h2>About Myself</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I grew up in Deerfield, Illinois and went to college in Nashville. I spent the greater part
							of my 20s in Washington D.C., then eventually landed New York City, where I attended urban
							planning graduate school.</p>

						<p>Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working on several critical social issues.
							At <a href='https://www.arnoldventures.org/'>Arnold Ventures</a>, a national strategic
							philanthropy, I conducted policy analysis and
							research to support a multi-million dollar grant portfolio aimed at criminal justice reform.
							At <a href='https://dbh.dc.gov/'>Washington D.C.'s Department of Behavioral Health</a>, I
							managed federal resources to support
							community-based responses to the city's opioid overdose epidemic. These experiences - along
							with other roles like advocating for climate change solutions at <a
								href='https://ecoamerica.org/'>ecoAmerica</a>, mentoring young
							students at <a href='https://higherachievement.org/become-a-mentor/'>Higher Achievement</a>,
							and tutoring in reading and writing at New York City public schools
							- have allowed me to enact a commitment to public service that guides me both personally
							and professionally. I aim to continue this ethic as I expand my career as an urban
							planner.</p>
						<p>The urban environment coheres many issues that motivate my study and practice. I think it is
							critical that we address the acute crises of homelessness and housing insecurity while
							pursuing larger visions of decommodified housing. I am inspired by economic democracy
							movements that seek to create shared, community-based food and energy assets. I am
							interested in how alternative governance and profit-sharing structures can support local
							economic development. I am guided by the tenets of community-based participatory action
							research. If any of these topics resonate with you too, check out my <a href="generic.html"
								class="button">reading list</a> to see
							what is
							informing me at the moment and let's get in touch to discuss further! </p>
